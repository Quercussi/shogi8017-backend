### Notes:
1. **General APIs** (like account creation, game invites) do not require `roomId` since they are part of the **pre-game** flow.
2. **Game-related APIs** (like game moves, offers, and responses) require a `roomId` because they are tied to specific game sessions.
3. **WebSocket connections** and interactions are scoped by `roomId`, ensuring that gameplay happens within the correct context.
